# steam-autologin
Auto login utility for linux.

This application edits registry.vdf that Steam uses to autologin user accounts. This is created so you can switch between multiple user profiles without having to manually log in every time you wish to change an account.

Usage:
`dotnet steam-autologin.dll <username>`

After running this program, restart Steam.
